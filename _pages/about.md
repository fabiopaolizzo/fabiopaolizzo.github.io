I architect and deploy proprietary AI systems to develop **novel, uncorrelated alpha** from alternative data. My primary focus is quantitative finance, where for the past five years I have engineered a **complete trading ecosystem** to research and validate these strategies in live markets.

My approach integrates a unique combination of leadership, systems architecture, and deep AI expertise. My skills in cutting-edge AI are validated through ongoing consulting on **Large Language Model** (**LLM**) **and Knowledge Graph architecture** for major EU projects.

My **large-scale leadership** is grounded in a 25-year track record of securing competitive funding, culminating in my role as Scientific Coordinator for multi-million-euro **flagship EU research programs** that earned an **'Excellent' rating**. This work is all built on a deep architectural foundation of **30 years of hands-on systems architecture** and a distinguished academic career, including a **Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Global Fellowship**. As a leader in my field, I have also **authored novel curricula** in AI and Signal Processing at the graduate level and **mentored students to win prestigious awards, including the Fulbright**.


**Specialties**: ***Quantitative Strategy, Alpha Signal Research, Systems Architecture, Deep Learning, LLMs, Time-Series Analysis, NLP, Unstructured Data, Python.***
