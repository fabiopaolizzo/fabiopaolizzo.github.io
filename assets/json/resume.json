    "summary": "An AI Researcher and Systems Architect with a primary focus on Quantitative Finance. I develop novel, uncorrelated alpha by designing and deploying proprietary trading systems that model complex human behavior and value perception in financial markets. My approach is built on a unique combination of deep, long-term experience: 30 years of hands-on systems architecture, 25 years of leadership in grant-funded AI, and 5 years of R&D architecting a proprietary, alpha-generating trading ecosystem for the live market validation of novel AI models.",
