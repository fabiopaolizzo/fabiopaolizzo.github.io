# Personal Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal professional website, which is live at [fabiopaolizzo.github.io](https://fabiopaolizzo.github.io).

## Purpose

This site serves as a central, curated hub for my professional profile, featured work, and contact information. It is designed to provide a high-level overview of my expertise in AI, Systems Architecture, and Quantitative Finance.

## Theme and Attribution

This website is built using the excellent [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) academic Jekyll theme. I am deeply grateful to the creators and contributors of this project for providing such a clean and powerful template.

This repository contains my personal customizations, content, and configuration files for the theme.
